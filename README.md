## Quick Start Guide

1. Create a virtual environment: `bash
python3 -m venv venv   `

2. Activate the virtual environment: `bash
source venv/bin/activate   `

3. Install dependencies: `bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt   `

4. Start the agent: `bash
python3 agent.py start   `

### Troubleshooting

- If requirements are not installed, make sure you're in the activated virtual environment and try running the pip install command again
- Verify your virtual environment is activated by checking for `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt
